		<p class="productwords1">Attended Deloitte Consulting Studio Jam to experience how the InsightStudio team operates at Deloitte. Worked in a team of 5, and tasked with coming up with a plan to solve a critical problem at Zingerman’s Delicatessen. My team came up with the idea of creating an application to combat unpleasant and unexpected wait time for customers on a Football Saturday at the University of Michigan. I hand wrote the prototype as a deliverable and brainstormed ideas for the rewards system. Additionally, my team presented our idea to representatives from the InsightStudio. </p>

		<p class="productwords2">My program uses a Facebook group “Syosset Babysiters Network,” to get of essentially all babysitters in that area looking for jobs. This is a closed group, however I had the access token, since I am a member. It checks to see if each member has a Twitter profile, and then evaluates profiles based on “score” (if they've Tweeted “bad” things.) The purpose is to evaluate each candidate. However, it can be used with any list of people to evaluate “character” or presence on Twitter. </p>

		<p class="productwords3"> Worked as a member of a team project to create a prototype for a mobile application that would facilitate the process of house hunting on a college campus. My role in the team included brainstorming ideas as well as  drawing the images and writing content on the deliverable.</p>

		<!<p class="productwords5">The Beauty section of the Macy’s website is divided into seven subcategories: Makeup, Skin Care, Beauty Brands, Additional Beauty, Impulse Brands, Fragrance, and Fragrance Brands. Through my own experience, I found that the subcategories are not organized in a way that is easy to navigate through when looking for specific beauty products. I conducted a closed card sort on seven participants in order to further evaluate the efficiency of the existing categories. Based on my findings, I created a sitemap to exemplify my recommendation for a new method of categorizing based on my findings. </p>
