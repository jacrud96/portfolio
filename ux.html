		<p class="uxwords1"> Conducting competitive analysis on four major StubHub competitors: SeatGeek, VividSeats, Ticket Liquidator, and Razorgator Tickets. I created a competitive matrix in order to compare each of the 5 different sites across 16 different attributes. <a href="file:///Users/Jaclyn/Desktop/Portfolio/PDF/422Final.pdf">Click here for PDF</a></p>

		<p class="uxwords2">Helped put together requirements the dynamic FourSquare creatives (categories, distance from kiosk, etc.) Watched creatives play on in-office Link kiosk to test functionality and usability. Throughout the duration of the summer, I communicated with other teams across the US to design and execute multiple versions of this creative for the dynamic campaign. </p>

		<p class="uxwords4">Tasked with researching the percentage of people below the poverty line in each NYC zip code. Established a poverty threshold for each zip code of anything above 25%, and consequently ran A/B tests in 27 out of the 67 NYC zip codes in order to improve the significance of results. Ran A/B tests on these Link kiosks, displaying creatives with varying text and images. Analyzed results using a heat map of Aunt Bertha searches on the Link tablets in order to gain insight to which version of the creative was most effective </p>

		<p class="uxwords5">The Beauty section of the Macy’s website is divided into seven subcategories: Makeup, Skin Care, Beauty Brands, Additional Beauty, Impulse Brands, Fragrance, and Fragrance Brands. Through my own experience, I found that the subcategories are not organized in a way that is easy to navigate through when looking for specific beauty products. I conducted a closed card sort on seven participants in order to further evaluate the efficiency of the existing categories. Based on my findings, I created a sitemap to exemplify my recommendation for a new method of categorizing based on my findings. </p>
